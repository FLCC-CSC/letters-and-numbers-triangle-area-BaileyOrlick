'''

1. What is the flow of the program? Which line of code kicks off the process?


The print() line is what executes the code.


2. What was the hardest part of this lab?


The hardest part for me was trying to remeber how to calculate the int for the equation, then I remebered that you have to actually write out the equation for area to be calculated and outputed.
